## ‚ú® 1. Overview & Background

The proliferation of IoT devices‚Äîfrom smart homes to critical industrial infrastructure‚Äîintroduces profound benefits in automation and data-driven efficiency. However, this interconnectedness presents significant security challenges. Many IoT devices suffer from **insufficient security measures** due to limited resources, and the ecosystem‚Äôs lack of standardized security protocols compounds the risk. A single vulnerability can compromise an entire network.

**Guardian: Securing Every Connection** was developed to bridge this critical security gap. It is a robust, proactive security solution specifically designed to address the unique vulnerabilities of resource-constrained and diverse IoT environments, ensuring the integrity and privacy of transmitted data.

## üéØ 2. Core Objectives

Guardian is focused on delivering resilience and trustworthiness in the evolving IoT landscape through five key objectives:

| Icon | Objective | Description |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| ‚åö | **Real-Time Threat Detection** | Provides continuous monitoring to promptly identify suspicious activities, malware, and unauthorized access attempts *before* they can escalate. |
| üåê | **Continuous Network Monitoring** | Ensures a comprehensive, 24/7 overview of all network activity, analyzing data flows and behavioral anomalies to detect irregularities like unusual traffic or unknown devices. |
| üîÑ | **Dynamic Security Protocols** | Employs adaptive security measures tailored to the specific resources and requirements of each device (e.g., lightweight encryption for low-power devices, MFA/IDS for complex systems). |
| üìà | **Scalability** | Designed with an architecture that scales seamlessly to protect networks of any size, from small smart homes to large industrial or smart city deployments. |
| üíª | **User-Friendly Interface** | Features an intuitive dashboard to simplify security management, monitoring, and threat response for users of all technical expertise levels. |
